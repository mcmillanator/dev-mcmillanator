        <h4>AmSched</h4>
        <p>
          AmSched is an amortization schedule manager.  An amortization
          schedule is the math used to calculate the interest on loans.
          Banks and real-estate companies use it on mortgages.  There are
          other amortization schedule calculators on the net.  AmSched is the
          first that allows you to save many schedules under one account so
          that you can come back to them later without having enter the loan
          terms a second time.
          </p>
        <p>
          This project is not open source.  I have gotten good feed back from
          many people and inted to develop this project into a business.
